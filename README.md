## Business Problem
Understanding product performance and customer preferences is crucial for optimizing sales strategies. For this analysis, we examined a dataset containing information on 100,000 orders from 2016 to 2018 across multiple e-commerce marketplaces in Brazil. Our objectives were to identify the best and worst-selling products, determine the most popular payment methods among customers, and analyze customer demographics. The results of this comprehensive analysis are displayed in an interactive dashboard using Streamlit. This dashboard enables stakeholders to gain insights into purchasing trends, tailor marketing efforts, and enhance the overall customer experience by aligning product offerings with consumer preferences.

## Data Wrangling
The initial step in my analysis involved gathering all necessary data, comprising 100,000 orders from multiple e-commerce marketplaces in Brazil between 2016 and 2018 from [Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce). I meticulously assessed the quality of the collected data to ensure its reliability and accuracy. This involved checking for missing values, inconsistencies, and duplicates. Following this assessment, I performed a thorough data-cleaning process to prepare the data for analysis. This step included handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, and removing duplicates. The cleaned data was then ready for in-depth analysis, enabling me to derive meaningful insights and actionable recommendations for stakeholders.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
As part of my analysis, I conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover valuable insights and answer key business questions. I began by formulating specific questions, such as identifying the best and worst-selling products, determining customers' preferred payment methods, and analyzing customer demographics. I examined various attributes and relationships through a detailed dataset exploration, employing statistical techniques and visualizations to extract meaningful patterns and trends. This thorough EDA process provided deep insights into customer behavior and preferences, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions and strategic improvements.

## Analysis and Visualization
After conducting a thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), I proceeded to answer all the previously formulated business questions. This involved identifying the best and worst-selling products, determining the preferred payment methods among customers, and analyzing customer demographics. To effectively communicate the results of my analysis, I created detailed data visualizations. These visualizations helped to convey insights and findings, making it easier for stakeholders to understand and act upon the information. By combining comprehensive analysis with intuitive visual representations, I enabled data-driven decision-making and strategic improvements.

Fig. 1. Best and Worst Performing Product by Number of Sales
   
Based on the presented data visualizations from Figure 1, it is evident that the best-selling product category is *"Bed Bath Table"*. This category significantly outperformed others regarding sales volume, indicating a high demand and preference among customers. Conversely, the least purchased category is *"CDs, DVDs, and Musicals"*, reflecting lower consumer interest and engagement in these products. These insights can guide inventory management and marketing strategies to focus on high-performing categories while reassessing the approach to lower-performing ones.

The visualizations of Figure 2 show that customers predominantly prefer using credit cards for their purchases. This payment method surpasses others in popularity, highlighting its convenience and widespread acceptance among buyers. Understanding this preference allows for the optimization of the checkout process to ensure a seamless and efficient payment experience, potentially increasing conversion rates and customer satisfaction.

Fig. 3. Number of Customers by City

The data visualizations from Figure 3, reveal that the majority of customers originate from the city of São Paulo. This demographic information is crucial for targeted marketing and regional sales strategies. By focusing efforts on this key customer base, businesses can tailor their marketing campaigns, promotional offers, and services to better meet the needs and preferences of São Paulo residents, thereby enhancing engagement and driving sales growth in this area.

## Interactive Data Analysis Dashboard
I developed an interactive data analysis report using Streamlit to present the findings in a user-friendly and dynamic dashboard. This Streamlit-based dashboard allows users to explore key insights, such as product sales performance, payment method preferences, and customer demographics, through an intuitive interface. By incorporating interactive features, like filters and drill-down options, the dashboard enables users to interact with the data and uncover detailed insights with ease. This approach simplifies the presentation of complex information and enhances the audience's ability to engage with and understand the results, ultimately supporting more effective and informed decision-making.
